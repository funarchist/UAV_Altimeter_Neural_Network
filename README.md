# UAV Flight Data Determination Using Machine Learning
# Background

The division involved specializes in UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) systems, with a subgroup aiming to innovate the determination of flight data. The goal was to eliminate the dependence on conventional hardware sensors by employing data-driven methods.

# Problem Statement

Current methods for determining flight data rely heavily on physical sensors, which can be costly, susceptible to wear, and limited in scalability. The challenge was to design a modular, scalable solution that leverages machine learning to infer flight data directly from alternative sources.

# Approach
# 1. Data Collection

    Gathered flight-related data from available real-world operations.
    Preprocessed data to ensure compatibility with machine learning models.

# 2. Model Development

    Designed multiple machine learning models for predicting flight parameters.
    Implemented algorithms in Python using libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

# 3. Training and Testing

    Trained models on the collected data, iteratively optimizing for accuracy and performance.
    Tested models against benchmark datasets to validate predictions.

# Deliverables

    Machine Learning Models: Trained models capable of determining flight data such as velocity, altitude, and orientation.
    Python Codebase: Includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
    Documentation: Detailed explanations of design decisions and methodologies.
    Appendices: Full source code and additional supporting materials.
